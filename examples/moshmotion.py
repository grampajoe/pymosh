# moshmotion.py: pymosh example by johannesgj
#
# this pymosh example uses the variable "interval" to control the amount of normal
# video frames to show before farming the reached p-frame in the same amount of 
# frames. Try it out with a low number of interval. lowest in this version is 
# interval = 2.
# it works extra well with timelapse movies! 
#
# Usage:
#   python moshmotion.py interval input-file
